# Yelp Camp

YelpCamp is a campground rating application, where users can create their own campgrounds, view and comment on other's campgrounds.
It uses the following technologies: Bootstrap, EJS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and others.

Every single line in this repository was written by me.

The concept/design of this app was taken from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course in udemy.
